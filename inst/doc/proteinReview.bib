                  interacting pairs of human proteins systematically,
                  a protein matrix of 4456 baits and 5632 preys was
                  screened by automated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)

                  interactions. Using topological and GO criteria, a
                  scoring system was developed to define 911
                  high-confidence interactions among 401
                  proteins. Furthermore, the network was searched for
                  interactions linking uncharacterized gene products
                  and human disease proteins to regulatory cellular
                  pathways. Two novel Axin-1 interactions were
                  validated experimentally, characterizing ANP32A and
                  CRMP1 as modulators of Wnt signaling. Systematic
                  human protein interaction screens can lead to a more
                  comprehensive understanding of protein function and
                  cellular processes.},
